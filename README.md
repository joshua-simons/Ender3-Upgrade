# Ender3-Upgrade
This is a description and tutorial on the upgrade path I took with my Creality Ender 3 Pro.  Created for my brother, Christian DiMarco, to follow.  My primary goal is to upgrade the Ender3 to be a better printer, and to be able to facilitating printing in ABS, Nylon, and Polycarbonate.

I pretty much exclusively use Linux (Mint), so the instructions in this tutorial are specific to my operating system (should work fine in Ubuntu as well, and with minimal tweaks Raspbian or any Debian-based distro as well).

### Directory Structure:

1. firmware: instructions on upgrading to the Marlin firmware.  I will give a tutorial, including pictures on how I went about this, and step by step how to do it yourself.
2. hardware: tutorial on the hardware upgrade path I took.  It will include step by step installation and calibration instructions
3. OctoPrint: tutorial on how I installed and integrated OctoPrint with the printer.  This is the software tutorial.  The hardware side is covered in the pi-integration directory.
4. parts: a listing of parts used.  This is broken down into two categories: parts I bought, and parts I printed.  Links to the STLs I printed are provided, as are where I sourced the parts.
5. pi-integration: hardware tutorial on assembling the Raspberry Pi parts, and integrating them with the printer.
