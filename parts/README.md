## Purchased:

[**Printer:** Creality Ender 3 Pro](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-ender-3-pro-3d-printer) 

[**Enclosure:**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081Q28J1M/) Creality Dustproof & Fireproof Warm Enclosure 3D Printer Tent: I want to print ABS.  I also keep my printer in my workshop in the shed.  Dust protection is necessary, and having a little extra fire prevention is never a bad thing.

**[All Metal Hot End and Direct Drive Extruder:]( https://store.micro-swiss.com/products/micro-swiss-direct-drive-extruder)** Micro Swiss:

**Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB Ram:**  Probably overkill.  If buying a Pi, I would go with the least expensive Pi 4 or go with a Pi 3 B+.  I used the 4 because I already had it laying around, waiting for a project, and with the 'rona the price of these things has skyrocketed.  I would have used my 3, but it has all of the stuff I'm using to teach my class on it.  The Pi Zero W lacks the ass necessary to run the software.

[**SmartPi Touch 2 Enclosure:**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WXK38YM) I know what you're thinking: "Why didn't you just print a case Bro?". Well mostly it's just because I couldn't find one that I liked, with cooling, that would mount in the way I wanted it to.  If you want to design or print something that works for you, knock yourself out.  One thing to note: I really like the ender3 integrated pi cases I've seen, but if I'm printing high temperature materials inside the tent, I'm going to want the Pi outside of the tent for cooling.

**[Raspberry Pi Official 7 Inch Touch Screen:](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073S3LQ6Q/ )**  You could go with something smaller, or bigger, or different, or whatever.  I've used these before, and I think they are a pretty good balance of cost and reliability.  Also since it is officially supported, getting it to work is easy.

[**Pi Camera:**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN8HB1R)  You need to be able to watch it while it prints.

[LANMU Micro SD to SD Card Extension Cable Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WLKLTTY): I prefer to use SD cards over microSD, and I have a bunch more of them.

[**ELEGOO UNO R3 Board:**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EWOE0UU) This is the Ardrino board necessary to flash the bootloader in order to install the TH3D Firmware.

[**TH3D EZABL Auto Bed Leveling Kit:**](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/ezabl-pro-plug-print-auto-bed-leveling-kit/) I also got the aluminum posts to eliminate the springy board adjustments.  This sensor is basically why I went with the TH3D firmware over vanilla Marlin.

**Need to add Fans once cooling ducts are worked out.**

## Printed:

**LCD Display Cover:** Keeps gunk out of the LCD control board.  I used the one that utilizes factory screws, and keeps the sound hole open.
